  - But there are some complexities wrt the Installation video given above. The Current Version of MongoDB that I have installed is 6.0.3 and in this version the Legacy MongoDB Shell is unavailable. So a new and enhanced MongoDB Shell aka `mongosh` need to be installed separately so that the MongoDB Servers could run properly.
